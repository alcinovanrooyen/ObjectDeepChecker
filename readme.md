# Object Deep Checker

This function was inpsired by the need for ensuring two copies of an object with a similar structure could be obtained and the values of the two objects can differ as long as the properties of the two objects are 100% mirrorred properties of each other.

I also took it further to allow values to be set within this function, values that have to be retrieved asynchronously.
