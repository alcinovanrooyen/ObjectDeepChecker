# Object Deep Checker

This function was inpsired by the need for ensuring two copies of an object, with a similar structure, can be obtained and the values of the two objects can differ as long as the properties of the two objects are 100% mirrorred properties of each other, even nested properties, thus the recursion in the function.

I also took it further to allow property values to be set asynchronously within this function.
